    Clock properties are set in the 'Countdown clock settings' part of the main window.<br>
    Start minutes and start seconds are set to 10:00 by default, but can be changed
    by the user, in case there is a need to reset the clock during the game.<br>
    If a user wishes to use hundreds of a second type countdown in the last minute
    there is a checkbox to select that. If the checkbox is not selected the countdown
    step is always one second.<br>
    If a user wishes for the countdown clock to sound a buzzer, when the time is completed,
    the checkbox 'Sound buzzer at end of time' must be selected.<br>
    User also has an option to control the background and the foreground color
    of the main clock display.
    <br><br>
    
    <h2><a name="setting_teams"></a>Setting up the teams info</h2>
    Team properties are set in the 'Teams settings' part of the main window.<br>
    If a user wishes to display the team names and score in the countdown window
    the checkbox 'Display team names and score' must be selected.<br>
    In this case team names and score must be entered in the 'Left team' and 'Right team' input fields.
    <br><br>
    
    <h2><a name="operating_clock"></a>Operating the countdown clock</h2>
    To start using the countdown clock 'Start Clock' button must be pressed in the main window.<br>
    If the display supports it the countdown clock will be displayed in full screen mode.<br>
    The following buttons are used to operate the countdown clock:<br>
    - 'Space' - starts and stops the clock.<br>
    - 'CTRL + R' - Resets the clock.<br>
    - 'Escape' - exits the countdown window and returns to the main window of the program.<br>
    - 'T' - stops the main clock and starts the time out countdown.<br>
    - 'CTRL + T' - stops the time out countdown.<br>
    <br><br>
      
    <h2><a name="operating_score"></a>Operating the team score</h2>
    If a user chose to display the team score as well it is located above the main clock
    in the countdown window.<br>
    There are four buttons to operate the teams score:<br>
    - 'Left arrow' - increases the score of left team by one.<br>
    - 'Right arrow' - increases the score of right team by one.<br>
    - 'Up arrow' decreases the score of left team by one.<br>
    - 'Down arrow' decreases the score of right team by one.<br>
    <br><br>
      
    <h2><a name="saving_settings"></a>Saving the settings</h2>
    When a user closes the program his preferences are saved to a file called
    'GoalballClock.properties', which is created in user's home directory.<br>
    The next time the program is started preferences are read from this file,
    so there is no need to set them again.<br>
    At the moment the preferences that are saved include:<br>
    - Use hundreds for last second<br>
    - Sound buzzer at end of time<br>
    - Background color<br>
    - Foreground color<br>
    - Display team names and score<br>
